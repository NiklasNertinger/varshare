In this paper, we propose multi-task RL with soft modularization for robotics manipulation tasks. Our method improves the sample efficiency as well as the success rate over the baselines by a large margin. The advantage becomes more obvious when given more diverse tasks. This shows that soft modularization allows effective sharing and reusing network components across tasks, which opens up future opportunities to generalize the policy to unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner.
